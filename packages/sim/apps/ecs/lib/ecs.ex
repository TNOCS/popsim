    Entity-Component-System (ECS) is a distributed and compositional architectural design pattern
    that is mostly used in game development and for large scale simulations. It enables flexible
    decoupling of domain-specific behaviour, which overcomes some of the drawbacks of traditional
    object-oriented inheritance.
